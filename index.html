                Find the two forms at the buttons indicated named "Pre-course Assessment-1" and "Pre-course
                Assessment-2". Fill the first form on Friday, October 4, from 12:30 PM to 6:30 PM EAT. <mark> <em> 
                Students should not refer to their
                    notes, text books and the internet to provide feedback for the first form.</em> </mark> <br><br>
                <mark> <em> The second form is to be filled by students at home after they made a careful study and research
                    on the themes of the questions under consideration.</em></mark> Students should use their own words and
                expressions while providing feedback. <mark> <em> Incase of need to borrow other authors' words and expressions they
                should properly cite them with APA (American Psychological Association) Citation style.</em></mark> You can optionally
                read a note named <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-XiqGyiyjx7VDQOqnIS8OhwHZ0AVGXFL/view?usp=sharing">A short note on APA style citation here</a>. The second form will be
                available from Saturday, October 5, 2024 7:30 AM to Wednesday, October 09, 2024 12:30 PM EAT. <br><br> 
                Make sure not to miss the given time intervals to provide your feedbacks. <br><br>
            <mark> <em> Students should cite an AI service if they use any. However if english is your second language, we recommend
                    for you to compose you texts manually in
                order to strengthen your english language skill.</em></mark>
                The successful completion of both tasks will contribute to your total marks on the course with 5%.
